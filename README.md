# Distance-Matrix

Plan to use GCP's [Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/start)

Ideally, when complete this will allow people who may be less tech savvy to input a list of places they go to (such as doctors offices, family/friend's houses, grocery stores, etc) and generate a nice way to view the distance and average time to get to all of them. Potentially show travel times for different days of week and times.
