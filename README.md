# Distance-Matrix

This project allows users to input a list of places they go to (such as doctors offices, family/friend's houses, grocery stores, etc) and generate a nice way to view the distance and average time to get to all of them. The user is able to set a departure/arrival time, change their travel type(driving, walking, cycling), set units(imperial or metric), and choose to avoid certain things (tolls, highways, ferries, indoor) on their trip! Once the form is submitted, a table is displayed on the webpage, and a printable pdf is generated with the same information.

My motivation for this was to create a tool for people who may not be tech-savvy or comfortable enough to use their computer to get this sort of information. For example, someone who is elderly could submit this form, print the pdf, and keep it on hand for quick reference.
