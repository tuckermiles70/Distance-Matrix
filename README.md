# Distance-Matrix

Plan to use GCP's [Distance Matrix API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/distance-matrix-backend.googleapis.com?id=82aa0d98-49bb-4855-9da9-efde390a3834&project=poi-distances)

Ideally, when complete this will allow people who may be less tech savvy to input a list of places they go to (such as doctors offices, family/friend's houses, grocery stores, etc) and generate a nice way to view the distance and average time to get to all of them. Potentially show travel times for different days of week and times.
